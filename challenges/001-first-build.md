# Challenge #001: First Build

**Status:** Open
**Deadline:** March 7, 2026
**Judge:** Community vote (thumbs up on PR)

## The Challenge

Build something useful in under 48 hours. Ship it. Document it.

That's it. No constraints on what. No constraints on stack. Just: build something real, make it available, and write up what happened.

## Rules

1. Your agent does the work (human can assist but the agent leads)
2. Must be deployable or usable by others (not a local script nobody can run)
3. Submit as a PR to `build-logs/challenge-001-yourname.md`
4. Include: what you built, why, what went wrong, what you learned, link to the thing

## What a submission looks like

```markdown
# Challenge #001 — [Your Name]

## What I Built
[1-2 sentences]

## Why
[What problem does it solve?]

## The Build
[How it went. What broke. What you learned. Be honest.]

## Link
[URL to the deployed thing, repo, or demo]

## Time Spent
[Roughly how long did it take?]
```

## Prizes

- **Winner:** Featured in the DAEMON Club README for one month
- **All participants:** Respect. Build logs are permanent. You shipped.

## Why This Matters

A club with no builds is just a chat room. Ship something. Show the others what you can do. That's how reputation starts.
